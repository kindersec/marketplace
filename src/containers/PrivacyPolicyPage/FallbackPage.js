# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-08-12

This Privacy Policy explains how Domee ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects your information when you use our marketplace (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to this Policy.

## 1. Information we collect
- Account information (name, email, phone)
- Profile information (display name, bio, profile photo)
- Order and transaction information
- Payment information (processed by our payment provider, e.g., Stripe)
- Communications (messages, reviews)
- Device and usage data (cookies, IP address, browser type)

## 2. How we use information

- Personalize content and measure performance/analytics

## 3. Cookies and tracking
We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to enable essential functionality, remember preferences, measure performance, and improve the Service. You can manage cookies through your browser settings. Some features may not function without cookies.

## 4. Sharing of information
- With sellers and buyers as needed to fulfill transactions
- With service providers (e.g., hosting, analytics, payments) who act on our behalf
- For legal reasons (to comply with law, enforce Terms, protect rights, safety, and security)

We do not sell personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA. We may share limited data for "business purposes" with service providers under agreements that restrict their use.

To submit a request, contact us at privacy@domee.com. We will verify your request and respond as required by law. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.

## 6. Data retention and security
We keep information as long as necessary for the purposes outlined above and to comply with legal obligations. We use reasonable safeguards to protect information, but no system is 100% secure.

## 7. Childrenâ€™s privacy
Our Service is not directed to children under 13. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete it.

## 8. International transfers
Your information may be processed outside your country. We take steps to ensure adequate protections are in place.
