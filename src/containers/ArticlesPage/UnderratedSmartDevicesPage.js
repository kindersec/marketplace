                <h2>The Overlooked Champions of the Smart Home</h2>

                <div className={css.deviceItem}>
                  <h3>1. Smart Water Leak Detectors</h3>
                  <p><strong>Why They're Underrated:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    Water damage is one of the most common and costly issues homeowners face. Yet, many fail to consider smart water leak detectors as an essential part of their smart home arsenal. These devices can save you thousands of dollars in repairs by alerting you to leaks before they become disasters.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>How They Work:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    Smart water leak detectors are equipped with sensors that detect moisture and send alerts to your smartphone. Some models even shut off the water supply automatically when a leak is detected, offering an extra layer of protection.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Recommended Product:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Flo by Moen Smart Water Detector</em> - This device not only alerts you to leaks but also monitors humidity and temperature, providing comprehensive protection against water damage.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Practical Use Case:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    Imagine being on vacation when a pipe bursts in your basement. A smart water leak detector can notify you immediately and, if integrated with a smart water valve, shut off the water supply, minimizing damage.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div className={css.deviceItem}>
                  <h3>2. Smart Blinds and Shades</h3>
                  <p><strong>Why They're Underrated:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    While smart lighting grabs headlines, smart blinds and shades often fly under the radar. Yet, they offer unparalleled convenience, energy efficiency, and privacy control.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>How They Work:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    Smart blinds and shades can be programmed to open and close based on a schedule, sunlight levels, or even voice commands. They can also integrate with other smart home systems to enhance energy efficiency by managing heat and light.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Recommended Product:</strong></p>

                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Practical Use Case:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    Set your smart shades to close during the hottest part of the day to keep your home cool and reduce air conditioning costs, or open them in the morning to wake up with natural light.

                  <h3>3. Smart Air Quality Monitors</h3>
                  <p><strong>Why They're Underrated:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    While many focus on smart thermostats, air quality monitors are the unsung heroes of a healthy home environment. They provide insights into the air you breathe, which is crucial for maintaining good health.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>How They Work:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    These devices measure pollutants, humidity, and temperature, providing real-time data and alerts. They can also suggest actions to improve air quality, such as increasing ventilation or adjusting your HVAC system.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Recommended Product:</strong></p>

                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Practical Use Case:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    If your air quality monitor detects high levels of VOCs due to cleaning products, it can trigger your smart ventilation system to increase airflow, keeping your indoor environment safe and comfortable.

                  <p><strong>Why They're Underrated:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    The kitchen is a hub of activity, yet smart kitchen faucets often go unnoticed. These devices add a layer of convenience and hygiene that's hard to beat.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>How They Work:</strong></p>
