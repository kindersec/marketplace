                <h2>Understanding the Basics</h2>

                <div className={css.tipItem}>
                  <h3>1. Smart Home</h3>
                  <p>
                    A smart home is a residence equipped with devices that can be controlled remotely via a smartphone, tablet, or computer. These devices often communicate with each other and can be automated based on your preferences.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div className={css.tipItem}>
                  <h3>2. Internet of Things (IoT)</h3>
                  <p>
                    IoT refers to the network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>

              <div className={css.articleContent}>
                <h2>Essential Components</h2>

                <div className={css.tipItem}>
                  <h3>3. Smart Hub</h3>
                  <p>
                    A smart hub is a centralized device that connects and controls all your smart home gadgets. Examples include the Samsung SmartThings Hub and Amazon Echo Plus. These hubs can manage diverse protocols and provide a unified app interface.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div className={css.tipItem}>
                  <h3>4. Zigbee and Z-Wave</h3>
                  <p>
                    These are popular wireless communication protocols used in smart home devices. Zigbee and Z-Wave facilitate device communication without relying on Wi-Fi, which can help reduce network congestion.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When selecting devices, ensure they are compatible with your chosen protocol to avoid connectivity issues.</p>
                </div>

                <div className={css.tipItem}>
                  <h3>5. Voice Assistants</h3>
                  <p>
                    Voice assistants like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri allow users to control smart devices hands-free. They can perform tasks such as setting reminders, controlling lights, or playing music.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> The Amazon Echo Dot is an affordable way to introduce Alexa into your home.</p>
                </div>
              </div>

              <div className={css.articleContent}>
                <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>

                <div className={css.tipItem}>
                  <h3>6. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>
                  <p>
                    2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring not only a password and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should know or have immediately to hand.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Advice:</strong> Always enable 2FA on your smart home apps to enhance security.</p>
                </div>

                <div className={css.tipItem}>
                  <h3>7. Encryption</h3>
                  <p>
                    Encryption is the process of converting data into code to prevent unauthorized access. Look for devices that offer end-to-end encryption to protect your personal information.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>

                <div className={css.tipItem}>
                  <h3>8. Smart Thermostat</h3>
                  <p>
                    A smart thermostat, like the Nest Learning Thermostat, learns your schedule and adjusts temperatures accordingly, helping save on energy bills.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Program your thermostat to lower the heat when you're at work and warm up before you return home.</p>
                </div>

                <div className={css.tipItem}>
                  <h3>9. Energy Monitoring</h3>
                  <p>
                    Devices like the Sense Energy Monitor provide insight into your energy usage, allowing you to identify waste and optimize consumption.

                  <h3>10. Smart Lighting</h3>
                  <p>
                    Smart bulbs, such as Philips Hue, can change colors, dim, and be scheduled or controlled remotely. They can even sync with your music or movies for an immersive experience.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Set your lights to gradually brighten in the morning for a more natural waking experience.</p>
                </div>

                <div className={css.tipItem}>
                  <h3>11. Smart Speaker</h3>
                  <p>
                    A smart speaker is a wireless speaker with an integrated virtual assistant. It can stream music, deliver news, and control smart home devices.
                  </p>
