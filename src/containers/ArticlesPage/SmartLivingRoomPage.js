                <div className={css.stepItem}>
                  <h3>Why Smart Lighting?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Smart lighting is often the first step in creating a smart living room. It offers more than just convenience; it's about setting the right ambiance, improving energy efficiency, and enhancing your home's security.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Getting Started with Smart Bulbs</h4>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Smart Bulbs:</strong> Start by replacing your traditional bulbs with smart bulbs like the <strong>Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance</strong>. These bulbs connect to your Wi-Fi, allowing you to control them through an app on your smartphone or via voice commands using a smart assistant like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Features:</strong> Change colors, adjust brightness, and set schedules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> LED technology reduces energy consumption.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4>Install Smart Light Switches</h4>
                  <p>
                    If you prefer a more permanent solution, consider smart light switches. The <strong>Lutron Caséta Wireless Smart Lighting Dimmer Switch</strong> is an excellent choice. It integrates with various smart home platforms and offers control over both smart and non-smart bulbs.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Voice Control:</strong> Compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scenes and Schedules:</strong> Create scenes for different activities, such as "Movie Night" or "Reading Time."</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Practical Tip:</strong> Create a routine where your lights slowly brighten in the morning to simulate a sunrise, helping you wake up naturally.</p>

                    Upgrade your entertainment system with a smart TV or streaming device like the <strong>Roku Streaming Stick+</strong> or <strong>Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K</strong>. These devices offer a plethora of streaming options, including Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Voice Search:</strong> Find shows or control playback with your voice.</li>

                  </ul>

                  <h3>Smart Speakers and Sound Systems</h3>
                  <p>
                    For a hands-free experience, integrate a smart speaker like the <strong>Amazon Echo Studio</strong> or <strong>Google Nest Audio</strong>. These speakers not only deliver high-quality sound but also function as a hub for controlling other smart devices in your home.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Room Audio:</strong> Play music throughout your home, or customize playlists for each room.</li>
                    <li><strong>Voice Assistant:</strong> Ask questions, set reminders, or control your smart home ecosystem.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Picture this: It's Friday night, and you're ready to unwind. With a simple voice command, your smart lights dim, your TV launches Netflix, and your sound system starts playing your favorite chill-out playlist. No remote needed!</p>

                <h2>3. Optimize Climate Control with Smart Thermostats</h2>

                <div className={css.stepItem}>
                  <h3>Benefits of Smart Thermostats</h3>
                  <p>
                    Smart thermostats like the <strong>Nest Learning Thermostat</strong> or the <strong>Ecobee SmartThermostat with Voice Control</strong> optimize your home's heating and cooling, potentially saving you money on energy bills.
                  </p>

                    <li><strong>Learning Capability:</strong> These devices learn your schedule and preferences over time, adjusting automatically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remote Control:</strong> Adjust the temperature from anywhere using your smartphone.</li>

                  <h4>Installation Tips</h4>

                    Most smart thermostats are DIY-friendly, but ensure to check compatibility with your HVAC system before purchasing. The installation process generally involves connecting a few wires, and the app guides you through each step.
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>Practical Example:</strong> Imagine adjusting your home's temperature while on vacation to prevent energy waste, then setting it back to your preferred comfort level just before you arrive home.</p>

                <h2>4. Secure Your Space with Smart Security</h2>

                <div className={css.stepItem}>
                  <h3>Smart Cameras and Doorbells</h3>
                  <p>
                    Enhance your living room's security with smart cameras like the <strong>Arlo Pro 4</strong> or smart doorbells like the <strong>Ring Video Doorbell 4</strong>. These devices offer real-time alerts and high-definition video, letting you monitor your home from anywhere.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Motion Detection:</strong> Receive alerts when motion is detected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Two-Way Audio:</strong> Communicate with visitors or potential intruders.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Smart Locks</h3>
                  <p>
                    Upgrade your home's security with a smart lock like the <strong>August Smart Lock Pro</strong>. This lock offers keyless entry and can be controlled remotely, providing both convenience and peace of mind.
                  </p>
                  <ul>

With a quick tap, you unlock your smart lock remotely, allowing the package to be placed inside safely.</p>

                <h2>5. Integrate Smart Assistants for Seamless Control</h2>

                <div className={css.stepItem}>
                  <h3>Choosing Your Smart Assistant</h3>
                  <p>
                    Smart assistants like <strong>Amazon Alexa</strong>, <strong>Google Assistant</strong>, or <strong>Apple's Siri</strong> act as the brain of your smart home, allowing you to control all connected devices with simple voice commands.

                  <h4>Setting Up Routines and Skills</h4>
                  <p>
                    With your smart assistant, you can create routines that automate multiple actions with a single command. For instance, saying "Alexa, I'm home" could turn on the lights, play music, and adjust the thermostat.
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>Practical Tip:</strong> Keep your smart assistant in a central location in your living room for optimal voice recognition and accessibility.</p>
